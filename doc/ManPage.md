# SUMMARY #

A platform-independent implementation of the core of the printf family of 
functions with significant extensions for formatting output.

# INTRODUCTION #

In most standard C libraries the `printf` family of functions can be rather 
heavy to use - they pull in quite a lot of additional library code, and they 
often require considerable additional effort to support on small or even
 medium-sized embedded projects.

The `format` library answers this need.  It provides a small, efficient core 
function which implements the majority of the `printf` conversions, requires 
little in the way of system support, and can be easily ported to work with a 
wide range of output devices.


# SYNOPSIS #

```
#include "format.h"
int format( void * (*cons) (void *a, const char *s , size_t n),
             void * arg, const char *fmt, va_list ap );
```


# DESCRIPTION #

The `format` function sends strings of one or more characters to the consumer 
function `cons` under the control of the string pointed to by `fmt` that specifies 
how the subsequent arguments in `ap` are converted for output.  If there are 
insufficient arguments for the format, the behaviour is undefined.  The `format`
function returns when the end of the format string is encountered.

The format string `fmt` is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters
(not `%`), which are sent unchanged to the consumer function; and conversion 
specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments,
converting them, if applicable, according to the corresponding conversion specifier,
and then sending the result to the consumer function.


## The Consumer Function ##

```
void * cons( void *a, const char *s, size_t n )
```

The consumer function `cons` takes an opaque pointer `a`, a pointer to an array
of characters `s` and the number `n` of characters to consume from `s`.  It 
returns another opaque pointer which may be equal or different to `a` which 
will be passed to the next call to `cons`.  The consumer function returns NULL
to indicate an error condition, which will cease any further format processing 
and cause the `format` function to terminate with the `EXBADFORMAT` error code.

The first opaque pointer passed to the first call to `cons` is supplied as 
the argument `arg` to the call to `format` (see above).


## Conversion Specifiers ##

Each conversion specification is introduced by the character `%`.  After the 
`%`, the following appear in sequence:

  * Zero or more flags (in any order) that modify the meaning of the conversion
    specification.

  * An optional minimum field width. If the converted value has fewer characters
    than the field width, it is padded with spaces (by default) on the left (or 
    right, if the left adjustment flag, described later, has been given) to the
    field width.  The field width takes the form of an asterisk `*` (described
    later) or a decimal integer.

  * An optional precision that gives the minimum number of digits to appear for
    the `b`, `d`, `i`, `I`, `o`, `u`, `U`, `x`, and `X` conversions, the number
    of digits to appear after the decimal-point character for `e`, `E`, `f`, `F`
    and `k` conversoins, the maximum number of significant digits fro the `g` and
    `G` conversions, the maximum number of bytes to be written for `s` conversions,
    or the number of repetitions for `c` and `C` conversions. The precision takes
    the form of a period (.) followed either by an asterisk `*` (described later)
    or by an optional decimal integer; if only the period is specified, the
    precision is taken as zero. If a precision appears with any other conversion
    specifier, it is ignored.

  * An optional number base modifier that specifies the numeric base to be used
    by the `i`, `I`, `u` and `U` conversions. The base takes the form of a colon
    (:) followed by either an asterisk `*` (described later) or by an optional
    decimal integer; if only the colon is specified the base is taken as decimal.

  * An optional grouping modifier that specifies how digits are to be grouped for
    the `b`, `d`, `i`, `I`, `o`, `u`, `U`, `x`, and `X` conversions.  It is ignored
    for all other conversion specifiers.

    A grouping modifier starts with `[` and ends with `]`.  Within the parentheses
    are symbol-number group specifiers.  The number specifies the number of digits
    within that group; the symbol specifies the character that is inserted after 
    the group.  A value of zero disables that particular group.  Unless otherwise
    terminated the left-most grouping specifier is repeatedly applied to any
    remaining digits.  If a group specifier begins with `-` then this terminates 
    any further grouping.  Group specifications are processed right-to-left, 
    starting with the rightmost symbol-number group and processing leftwards.

    An asterisk `*` (described later) in place of the number takes the next int 
    argument after the value to be converted (note this is contra to the width and
    precision specifiers).  If the value is negative it is treated as a `-`, 
    terminating any further grouping.

  * An optional fixed-point modifier that specifies the widths of the integer and
    fractional parts of the argument to the k conversion.  It is ignored for all
    other conversion specifiers.  A fixed-point modifier starts with `{` and ends 
    with `}`.  Within the parentheses are an optional integer width specifier, 
    a period (.), and an optional fractional width specifier.  Both specifiers are 
    non-negative decimal integers, or asterisks `*` (described later) where negative 
    values are interpreted as zero.

  * An optional length modifier that specifies the size of the argument.

  * A conversion specifier character that specifies the type of conversion to be 
    applied.

As noted above, a field width, precision, or base, or any combination, may be 
indicated by an asterisk. In this case, an int argument supplies the field width,
precision or base.  The arguments specifying field width, precision, or base, or
any combination, shall appear (in that order) before the argument (if any) to be
converted. A negative field width argument is taken as a `-` flag followed by a
positive field width. A negative precision argument is taken as if the precision
were omitted. A negative base argument is taken as if the base were omitted.

### Flags ###

The flag characters and their meanings are:

| Flag | Description |
|:---|:---|
|`-`|   The result of the conversion is left-justified within the field.  It is right-justified if this flag is not specified.|
|`^`|   The result of the conversion is centre-justified within the field.  It is right-justified if this flag is not specified.  When there is an odd number of padding spaces the result of the conversion is biased to the right.  It is biased to the left if the `-` flag is also  specified.|
|`+`|   The result of a signed conversion always begins with a plus or minus sign. It begins with a sign only when a negative value is converted if this flag is not specified.|
|space| If the first character of a signed conversion is not a sign, or if a signed conversion results in no characters, a space is prefixed to the result. If the space and `+` flags both appear, the space flag is ignored.|
|`#`|   The result is converted to an alternative form. For `o` conversion, it increases the precision, if and only if necessary, to force the first digit of the result to be a zero (if the value and precision are both 0, a single 0 is printed). For `x` (or `X` or `b`) conversion, a nonzero result has `0x` (or `0X` or `0b`) prefixed to it. For continuation and `s` conversions, it indicates that the pointer argument is of an alternate form.  For `e`, `E`, `f`, `F`, `g` and `G` conversions, the result of converting a floating point number always contains a decimal point character, even if no digits follow it.  (Normally, a decimal point character appears in the result of these conversions only if a digit follows it.)  For `g` and `G` conversions, trailing zeros and not removed from the result.  For other conversions, the flag is ignored.|
|`!`|   For `b`, `x` and `X` conversions with the `#` flag the result is always prefixed, even when zero.  For `x` and `X` conversions the prefix is always `0x`.  For `e` and `E` conversions the exponent is forced to a multiple of three with one to three digits appearing before the decimal point.  For `f` and `F` conversions the result of the conversion is formatted to use the SI multiplier prefixes, with one to three digits appearing before the decimal point; where the result of the conversion is outside the range from 1.0 x 10<sup>-24</sup> up to but not including 1.0 x 10<sup>27</sup>, the result will not conform to this rule, although it will be correct. For other conversions, the flag is ignored.|
|`0`|   For `b`, `d`, `i`, `I`, `o`, `u`, `U`, `x`, `X`, `e`, `E`, `f`, `F`, `g` and `G`  conversions, leading zeros (following any indication of sign or base) are used to pad to the field width rather than performing space padding. If the `0` and `-` flags both appear, the `0` flag is ignored.  For `b`, `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, and `X` conversions, if a precision is specified, the `0` flag is ignored. For other conversions, the flag is ignored.|

### Length Modifiers ###

The length modifiers and their meanings are:

| Modifier | Description |
|:---|:---|
|`hh`|  Specifies that a following `b`, `d`, `i`, `I`, `o`, `u`, `U`, `x`, or `X` conversion specifier applies to a `signed char` or `unsigned char` argument (the argument will have been promoted according to the integer promotions, but its value shall be converted to `signed char` or `unsigned char` before printing); or that a following `n` conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a `signed char` argument. |
|`h`|   Specifies that a following `b`, `d`, `i`, `I`, `o`, `u`, `U`, `x`, or `X` conversion specifier applies to a `short int` or `unsigned short int` argument (the argument will have been promoted according to the integer promotions, but its value shall be converted to `short int` or `unsigned short int` before consuming); or that a following `n` conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a `short int` argument.|
|`l`(ell)| Specifies that a following `b`, `d`, `i`, `I`, `o`, `u`, `U`, `x`, or `X` conversion specifier applies to a `long int` or `unsigned long int` argument; or that a following `n` conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a `long int` argument.|
|`ll`(ell-ell)| Specifies that a following `n` conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a `long long int` argument.|
|`j`|   Specifies that a following `b`, `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, or `X` conversion specifier applies to an `intmax_t` or `uintmax_t` argument; or that a following `n` conversion specifier applies to a pointer to an `intmax_t` argument.|
|`z`|   Specifies that a following `b`, `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, or `X` conversion specifier applies to a `size_t` or the corresponding signed integer type argument; or that a following `n` conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a signed integer type corresponding to `size_t` argument.|
|`t`|   Specifies that a following `b`, `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, `x`, or `X` conversion specifier applies to a `ptrdiff_t` or the corresponding unsigned integer type argument; or that a following `n` conversion specifier applies to a pointer to a `ptrdiff_t` argument.|
|`L`|   Specifies that a following `e`, `E`, `f`, `F`, `g`, or `G` conversion specifier applies to a `long double` argument.  Until further notice this is an unsupported feature and will return an error.|

If a length modifier appears with any conversion specifier other than as 
specified above, the length modifier is ignored.

### Grouping Modifier ###

The grouping modifier specifies additional formatting rules for `b`, `d`, `i`,
`I`, `o`, `u`, `U`, `x`, and `X` conversion specifiers.  It is ignored for all 
other conversion specifiers.

A grouping modifier starts with `[` and ends with `]`.  Within the parentheses 
are symbol-number group specifiers.  The number specifies the number of digits 
within that group; the symbol specifies the character that is inserted after 
the group.  A value of zero disables that particular group.  Unless otherwise 
terminated the left-most grouping specifier is repeatedly applied to any 
remaining digits.  If a group specifier begins with `-` then this terminates 
any further grouping.  Group specifications are processed right-to-left, 
starting with the rightmost symbol-number group and processing leftwards.

An asterisk in place of the number takes the next `int` argument after the 
value to be converted (note this is contra to the width and precision 
specifiers).  If the value is negative it is treated as a '-', terminating 
any further grouping.

For example, "`[,3.2]`" comprises two groupings, the first specifies a group of
two digits and a period "`.`", the second specifies groups of three digits 
separated by commas.  Applied to the number `123456789` the output would be 
"`1,234,567.89`".

### Fixed-Point Modifier ###

The fixed-point modifier specifies the formatting rules for the `k` conversion
specifier.  It is ignored for all other conversion specifiers.

A fixed-point modifier starts with `{` and ends with `}`.  Within the 
parentheses are an optional integer width specifier, and period `.`, and a 
fractional width specifier.  Both specifiers are positive decimal integers or 
asterisks `*` as described above where negative values are treated as zero.

For example, "`{24.8}`" specifies a fixed-point format comprising 24 integer 
bits and 8 fractional bits.

### Conversion Specifiers ###

The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

| Specifier | Description |
|:---|:---|
|`d`,`i`,`I`| The `int` argument is converted to signed decimal (`d`) or signed number of the specified base (`i` or `I`)  in the style `[`-`]`dddd. The base specifies the number base. For bases greater than decimal the letters "A" to "Z" are used for `I` conversions, and "a" to "z" for `i` conversions.  The precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear; if the value being converted can be represented in fewer digits, it is expanded with leading zeros. The default precision is 1. The result of converting a zero value with a precision of zero is no characters. |
|`b`,`o`,`u`,`U`,`x`,`X`| The `unsigned int` argument is converted to unsigned binary (`b`),  unsigned octal (`o`), unsigned number of specified base (`u` or `U`), or unsigned hexadecimal notation (`x` or `X`) in the style `dddd`. For bases greater than decimal the letters "A" to "Z" are used for `X` and `U` conversions, and "a" to "z" for `x` and `u` conversions. The precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear; if the value being converted can be represented in fewer digits, it is expanded with leading zeros.  The default precision is 1. The result of converting a zero value with a precision of zero is no characters.|
| `e`,`E` |   A double argument representing a floating point number is converted in the style `[-]d.ddde[+/-]dd`, where there is one digit (which is non-zero if the argument is nonzero) before the decimal point character and the number of digits after it is equal to the precision; if the precision is missing, it is taken as 6; if the precision is zero and the `#` flag is not specified, no decimal point character appears.  The value is rounded to the appropriate number of digits.  The `E` conversion specifier produces a number with "E" instead of "e" introducing the exponent.  The exponent always contains at least two digits, and only as many more digits as necessary to represent the exponent.  If the value is zero, the exponent is zero.|
| `f`,`F` |   A double argument representing a floating point number is converted to decimal notation in the style `[-]ddd.ddd`, where the number of digits after the decimal point character is equal to the precision specification.  If the precision is missing, it is taken as 6; if the precision is zero and the `#` flag is not specified, no decimal point character appears.  If a decimal point character appears, at least one digit appears before it.  The value is rounded to the appropriate number of digits. |
| `g`,`G` |   A double argument representing a floating point number is converted in the style `f` or `e` (or in the style `F` or `E` in the case of a `G` conversion specifier), with the precision specifying the number of significant digits.  If the precision is zero, it is taken as 1.  The style used depends on the value converted; style `e` (or `E`) is used only if the exponent resulting from such a conversion is less than -4 or greater than or equal to the precision.  Trailing zeros are removed from the fractional portion of the result unless the `#` flag is specified; a decimal point character appears only if it is followed by a digit.  |
| `k` |       An integer argument representing a signed fixed-point argument is converted to decimal notation in the style of `f`.  The parameters of the fixed-point format are specified by the fixed-point modifier described above.  The default fixed-point format is 16p16. |
|`c`|         The `int` argument is converted to an `unsigned char`, and the resulting character is written.  The precision specifies how many times the character is written.  The default and minimum precision is 1.|
|`C`|         The character immediately following the conversion specifier is written.  The precision specifies how many times the character is written.  The default and minimum precision is 1.|
|`s`|         The argument is a pointer to the initial element of an array of character type. Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) the terminating null character. If the precision is specified, no more than that many bytes are written. If the precision is not specified or is greater than the size of the array, the array must contain a null character.  A NULL argument is treated as pointer to the string "(null)".|
|`p`|         The argument is a pointer to `void`. The value of the pointer is converted to a sequence of printing characters using the conversion specification `%#!N.NX`, where `N` is determined by the size of pointer to `int` on the target machine.|
|`n`|         The argument is a pointer to signed integer into which is written the number of characters passed to the consumer function so far by this call to `format`.  No argument is converted, but one is consumed. Only the `#` flag is interpreted. Any other flags, a field width, or a precision will be ignored.  A NULL argument is silently ignored.|
|`%`|         A `%` character is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is `%%`.|
|`"`|         The argument is a pointer to a string which is treated as a continuation of the format specification. Only the `#` flag is interpreted.  Any other flags, width, precision or length will be ignored.|

If a conversion specification is invalid, `format` returns an error code. If 
any argument is not the correct type for the corresponding conversion 
specification, bad mojo happens.

In no case does a nonexistent or small field width cause truncation of a field;
if the result of a conversion is wider than the field width, the field is 
expanded to contain the conversion result.


## Return Value ##

The `format` function returns the number of characters sent to the consumer 
function, or the negative value `EXBADFORMAT` if an output or encoding error 
occurred.


## Limits ##

The maximum width and precision are 500.  It is an error if values larger
than this are specified.

The largest number base is 36.  The smallest is 2.  A base of 0 (the default)
is treated as decimal (base 10).  It is an error to specify a base of 1 or
greater than 36.


# EXAMPLES #

The first example implements the same behaviour as the standard C library 
function `printf`.  First, the consumer function:

```
void * outfunc( void * op, const char * buf, size_t n )
{
    while ( n-- )
        putchar( *buf++ );

    return (void *)( !NULL );
}
```

In this case the opaque pointer is not used, and a non-NULL value is returned.
Second, the implementation of the `printf` function:

```
int printf ( const char *fmt, ... )
{
    va_list arg;
    int done;
    
    va_start ( arg, fmt );
    done = format( outfunc, NULL, fmt, arg );
    va_end ( arg );
    
    return done;
}
```

Because the opaque pointer is not used, and the consumer function ignores it,
a NULL is passed as the second argument to `format`.

The second example illustrates how the opaque pointer is used to implement the
standard C library function `sprintf`.  In this example the consumer function 
returns the address of the next location to receive any following characters:

```
void * bufwrite( void * memptr, const char * buf, size_t n )
{
    return ( memcpy( memptr, buf, n ) + n );
}
```

The implementation of `sprintf` is shown below, with an additional step to 
append a null character to the end of the string written into `buf`:

```
int sprintf( char *buf, const char *fmt, ... )
{
    va_list arg;
    int done;
    
    va_start ( arg, fmt );
    done = format( bufwrite, buf, fmt, arg );
    if ( 0 <= done )
	    buf[done] = '\0';
    va_end ( arg );
    
    return done;
}
```

The final example illustrates the use of the opaque pointer to support an LCD 
display with (x,y) positioning.  In this example a `struct` data type describes 
where the consumer function is to place its output:

```
struct coord {
	short x, y;
};
```

This example assumes the LCD is 80 characters wide, and follows the usual convention of
top-left being at (0,0).

The consumer function uses the `coord` to set the position for each character 
sent to the LCD calling a driver function `lcd_putc`:

```
void * lcd_putat( void * ap, const char *s, size_t n )
{
	struct coord *pc = (struct coord *)ap;
	
	while ( n-- )
	{
		lcd_putc( pc->x++, pc->y, *s++ );
		if ( pc->x >= 80 )
		{
			pc->x = 0;
			pc->y++;
		}
	}
	
	return (void *)pc;
}
```

The implementation of the `lcd_printf` function itself:

```
int lcd_printf( struct coord loc, const char *fmt, ... )
{
    va_list arg;
    int done;
    
    va_start ( arg, fmt );
    done = format( lcd_putat, &loc, fmt, arg );
    va_end ( arg );
    
    return done;
}
```

And an example call to this function might look like this:

```
    struct coord loc;
    int temperature;
    int status;
    
    temperature = 32;
    loc.x = 5;
    loc.y = 2;
    status = lcd_printf( loc, "Boiler temp = %+d Celsius", temperature );
    if ( status < 0 )
    {
    	/* error handler */
    }
```
